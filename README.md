## Why I created this website?
The languages spoken in Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Srilanka have so much in common because they come from same origin of Indo-Aryan Languages. Most of the words have same name and sound in most of those languages. I always wanted to know the meaning of particular thing and how they are being called in those languages. My main motto is to answer those curious minds who wants to research/study on Indo Aryan languages. 

## Indo Aryan Languages
Indo-Aryan languages, also called Indic languages, subgroup of the Indo-Iranian branch of the Indo-European language family. In the early 21st century, Indo-Aryan languages were spoken by more than 800 million people, primarily in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
