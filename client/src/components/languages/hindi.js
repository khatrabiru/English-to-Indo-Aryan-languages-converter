                <p>
                    Hindi language, member of the Indo-Aryan group within the Indo-Iranian branch of the
                    Indo-European language family. It is the preferred official language of India,
                    although much national business is also done in English and the other languages
                    recognized in the Indian constitution. In India, Hindi is spoken as a first language
                    by nearly 425 million people and as a second language by some 120 million more.

                    Outside of India, Hindi is spoken in Australia, Bangladesh, Belize, Bhutan, Botswana,
                    Canada, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Germany, Guyana, Kenya, Nepal, New Zealand,
                    Philippines, Singapore, Sint Maarten, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom,
                    United States, Yemen, Zambia (Ethnologue). Such a wide distribution makes Hindi one of
                    the most spoken languages of the world.

                <p>
                    Literary Hindi, written in the Devanagari script, has been strongly influenced by
                    Sanskrit. Its standard form is based on the Khari Boli dialect, found to the north
                    and east of Delhi. Braj Bhasha, which was an important literary medium from the 15th
                    to the 19th century, is often treated as a dialect of Hindi, as are Awadhi, Bagheli,
                    Bhojpuri, Bundeli, Chhattisgarhi, Garhwali, Haryanawi, Kanauji, Kumayuni, Magahi,
                    and Marwari. However, these so-called dialects of Hindi are more accurately described
                    as regional languages of the “Hindi zone” or “belt,” an area that approximates the
                    region of northern India, south through the state of Madhya Pradesh.

                    It is widely spoken and understood as a second language in Nepal, Bangladesh,
                    and the Persian Gulf and as such is considered a lingua franca in the Indian
                    subcontinent.[1] It is also one of the most widely spoken languages in the world
                    by total number of speakers.[2] It developed in north India, principally during
                    the Mughal Empire, when the Persian language exerted a strong influence on the
                    Western Hindi languages of central India; this contact between the Hindu and Muslim
                    cultures resulted in the core Indo-Aryan vocabulary of the Indian dialect of Hindi
                    spoken in Delhi, whose earliest form is known as Old Hindi, being enriched with
                    Persian loanwords.
