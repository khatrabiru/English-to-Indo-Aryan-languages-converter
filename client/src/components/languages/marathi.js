            <h1>Marathi Language</h1>
                <p>
                    Marathi language, Indo-Aryan language of western and central India. Its range extends from
                    north of Mumbai down the western coast past Goa and eastward across the Deccan; in 1966
                    it became the official language of the state of Maharashtra. The standard form of speech
                    is that of the city of Pune (Poona). Descended from the Mahārāṣṭrī Prākrit, Marathi has a
                    significant literature. Books are printed in Devanāgarī script, which is also used for
                    handwriting, although a closely related script, Modi, was also often used for handwriting
                    until the mid-20th century. Eastern Hindi is the Indo-Aryan language most closely related
                    to Marathi. Like Hindi, Marathi has lost most of its inflectional system to indicate case,
                    using instead postpositions (like prepositions, only following the word) with an oblique
                    “case” to serve the function originally filled by inflection.
                    Marathi distinguishes inclusive and exclusive forms of 'we' and possesses a three-way gender
                    system, that features the neuter in addition to the masculine and the feminine/

            <h1>History</h1>
                <p>
                    Marathi is derived from Sanskrit through a Prakrit dialect called Maharashtri in the 1st-2nd
                    centuries AD. It was the most widespread Prakrit dialect of its time. Maharashtri gradually
                    evolved into Marathi in the 15th and 16th centuries.

                    Indian languages, including Marathi, that belong to the Indo-Aryan language family are
                    derived from early forms of Prakrit. Marathi is one of several languages that further
                    descend from Maharashtri Prakrit. Further change led to the Apabhraṃśa languages like
                    Old Marathi; however, this is challenged by Bloch (1970), who states that Apabhraṃśa was
                    formed after Marathi had already separated from the Middle Indian dialect.

                    The earliest example of Maharashtri as a separate language dates to approximately 3rd
                    century BCE: a stone inscription found in a cave at Naneghat, Junnar in Pune district had
                    been written in Maharashtri using Brahmi script. A committee appointed by the Maharashtra
                    State Government to get the Classical status for Marathi has claimed that Marathi existed
                    at least 2300 years ago alongside Sanskrit as a sister language.[9] Marathi, a derivative
                    of Maharashtri, is probably first attested in a 739 CE copper-plate inscription found in
                    Satara. Several inscriptions dated to the second half of the 11th century feature Marathi,
                    which is usually appended to Sanskrit or Kannada in these inscriptions. The earliest
                    Marathi-only inscriptions are the ones issued during the Shilahara rule, including a c.
                    1012 CE stone inscription from Akshi taluka of Raigad district, and a 1060 or 1086 CE
                    copper-plate inscription from Dive that records a land grant (agrahara) to a Brahmin.
                    A 2-line 1118 CE Marathi inscription at Shravanabelagola records a grant by the
                    Hoysalas. These inscriptions suggest that Marathi was a standard written language
                    by the 12th century. However, there is no record of any literature produced in Marathi
                    until the late 13th century.
