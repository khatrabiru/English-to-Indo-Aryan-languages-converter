                <h2>Bengali Language</h2>
                <p>
                    Bengali language, Bengali Bangla, member of the Indo-Aryan group of the Indo-Iranian branch
                    of the Indo-European language family. It is spoken by more than 210 million people as a firsts
                    or second language, with some 100 million Bengali speakers in Bangladesh; about 85 million in
                    India, primarily in the states of West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura; and sizable immigrant
                    communities in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Middle East. It is the state
                    language of Bangladesh and one of the languages officially recognized in the constitution
                    of India.
                    Along with Assamese, it is geographically the most eastern of the Indo-Iranian languages.
                    Like other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Bengali arose from the eastern Middle Indic
                    languages of the Indian subcontinent. Rajbangsi, Kharia Thar and Mal Paharia are closely
                    related to Western Bengali dialects, but are typically classified as separate languages. Similarly, Hajong is considered a separate language, although it shares similarities to Northern Bengali dialects.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Like other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Bengali arose from the eastern Middle Indic
                    languages of the Indian subcontinent. Magadhi Prakrit, the earliest recorded spoken
                    language in the region and the language of the Buddha, had evolved into Ardhamagadhi
                    ("Half Magadhi") in the early part of the first millennium C.E. Ardhamagadhi,
                    as with all of the Prakrits of North India, began to give way to what are called
                    Apabhramsa languages just before the turn of the first millennium.[3] The local
                    Apabhramsa language of the eastern subcontinent, Purvi Apabhramsa or Apabhramsa Abahatta,
                    eventually evolved into regional dialects, which in turn formed three groups: the Bihari
                    languages, the Oriya languages, and the Bengali-Assamese languages. Some argue for much
                    earlier points of divergence, going back to as early as 500 C.E.,[4] but the language was
                    not static; different varieties coexisted and authors often wrote in multiple dialects.
                    For example, Magadhi Prakrit is believed to have evolved into Apabhramsa Abahatta, which
                    competed with Bengali for a period of time around the sixth century. There is general
                    agreement that in the distant past Oriya, Assamese, and Bengali formed a single branch,
                    from which Oriya split off first and Assamese later. This is one reason that the earliest
                    specimens of Bengali language and literature, the Charyapadas (Buddhist mystic songs), are
                    also claimed by speakers of Oriya and Assamese as their own.
