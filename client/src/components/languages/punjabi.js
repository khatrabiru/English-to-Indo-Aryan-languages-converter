                <h2>Punjabi Language</h2>
                <p>
                    Punjabi language, Punjabi also spelled Panjabi, one of the most widely spoken Indo-Aryan
                    languages. The old British spelling “Punjabi” remains in more common general usage than
                    the academically precise “Panjabi.” In the early 21st century there were about 30 million
                    speakers of Punjabi in India. It is the official language of the Indian state of Punjab
                    and is one of the languages recognized by the Indian constitution. In Pakistan Punjabi is
                    spoken by some 70 million speakers, mostly in Punjab province, but official status at both
                    the national and the provincial level is reserved for Urdu. There are also important overseas
                    communities of Punjabi speakers, particularly in Canada and the United Kingdom—where in the
                    early 21st century they respectively constituted the third and fourth largest linguistic
                    groups in the national populations—as well as in several parts of the United States.

                    Punjabi is one of the ancient Indo-Aryan languages that is considered the world's 9th most
                    widely spoken language. Punjabi is widely spoken by several people residing in India,
                    Pakistan, United States, United Arab Emirates, Canada, Australia, France, Netherlands,
                    New Zealand, Italy, and England. It is estimated that there are currently 113 million
                    people who speak Punjabi as their native language. At present, two scripts are used for
                    writing the Punjabi language. These include the Gurmukhi script used by the Sikhs residing
                    in India; and the Shahmukhi script mainly used by the Punjabi Muslims in the Punjab province
                    of Pakistan.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The word Punjabi has been derived from the Persian words ‘Punj’ and ‘ab’, where ‘Punj’ means five
                    and ‘ab’ means water. Therefore, the name Punjab means “the land of five rivers” and refers to the
                    five major tributaries of River Indus, including the Ravi, Jhelum, Chenab, Beas, and Sutlej that
                    flows through the Punjab region. It is believed that the Punjabi language originated as an ‘Apabhramsa’
                    form of the Prakrit language in the 7th century and became established by the 10th century. Punjabi is
                    also thought to have originated from the Paishachi Prakrit language, widely spoken in India’s northern
                    and north-western parts. The earliest writings in the Punjabi language belong to the Nath Yogi period,
                    dating from the 9th to 14th century AD. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, made it a “sacred language.
                    ”His successor Guru Angad further enriched the Punjabi language by developing its Gurmukhi script.
                    Guru Arjan Dev – the 5th Sikh Guru, compiled the “Adi Granth” or the first volume of the holy Guru
                    Granth Sahib in the language’s Gurmukhi script. With the Muslim conquests of the Indian Subcontinent,
                    many Arabic and Persian words became incorporated into the Punjabi language.
