                <h2>Gujarati Language</h2>
                <p>
                    Gujarati language, Indo-Aryan member of the Indo-Iranian group of Indo-European languages.
                    Gujarati is officially recognized in the Indian constitution and is spoken by more than 46
                    million people. Most of these reside in the Indian state of Gujarat, though there are
                    significant diaspora communities around the world, especially in the United Kingdom and the
                    United States. The development of the language can traced to approximately the 12th century CE.
                    Gujarati inflection is fairly complex, marking three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter),
                    two numbers (singular and plural), and three cases (nominative, oblique, and agentive-locative)
                    for nouns. It is usually written with a cursive form of Devanagari script. Differences in religion,
                    caste, ethnicity, profession, and education overlap with regional distinctions to create a complex
                    system of language varieties in which sharp dialect boundaries cannot be drawn. Linguists have discerned
                    two general pairs of dialect groups, however. The first is based on differing phonology: some groups
                    use a “tight” phonation, spoken with a raised larynx; others use a “murmured” phonation, spoken with
                    the intermittent lowering of the larynx. The second dialect pair is based on ethnicity, as there are
                    recognizable distinctions between speakers who are Parsi and those who are Bohra.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The first grammar of a precursor of Gujarati was written in the 12th century. The first
                    literary records of Gujarati were mostly religious verses dating back to the 17th century.
                    The language was later cultivated by writers, scholars, and poets from Narasimha Mehta to
                    Mahatma Gandhi. The study of Gujarati in the 19th century can be credited to a British
                    colonial administrator named Alexander Kinloch Forbes who explored much of the previous
                    thousand years of the history of Gujarati and compiled a large number of manuscripts.

                    Gujarati (also sometimes spelled Gujerati, Gujarathi, Guzratee, Guujaratee, Gujrathi, and
                    Gujerathi) is a modern Indo-Aryan (IA) language evolved from Sanskrit. The traditional
                    practice is to differentiate the IA languages on the basis of three historical stages.

                    Old Gujarātī (જૂની ગુજરાતી; 1200 CE-1500 CE), the ancestor of modern Gujarati and Rajasthani,
                    was spoken by the Gurjars, who were residing and ruling in Gujarat, Punjab, Rajputana and
                    central India. The language was used as literary language as early as the 12th century.
                    Texts of this era display characteristic Gujarati features such as direct/oblique noun
                    forms, postpositions, and auxiliary verbs. It had three genders, as Gujarati does today,
                    d by around the time of 1300 CE, a fairly standardized form of this language emerged.
                    While generally known as Old Gujarati, some scholars prefer the name of Old Western Rajasthani,
                    based on the argument that Gujarati and Rajasthani were not yet distinct. Factoring into this
                    preference was the belief that modern Rajasthani sporadically expressed a neuter gender,
                    based on the incorrect conclusion that the [ũ] that came to be pronounced in some areas for
                    masculine [o] after a nasal consonant was analogous to Gujarati's neuter [ũ]. A formal grammar,
                    Prakrita Vyakarana, of the precursor to this language, Gurjar Apabhraṃśa, was written by Jain
                    monk and eminent scholar Acharya Hemachandra Suri in the reign of Chaulukya king Jayasimha
                    Siddharaja of Anhilwara (Patan).
