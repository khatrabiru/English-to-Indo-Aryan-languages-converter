                    Urdu language, member of the Indo-Aryan group within the Indo-European family of
                    languages. Urdu is spoken as a first language by nearly 70 million people and as
                    a second language by more than 100 million people, predominantly in Pakistan and
                    India. It is the official state language of Pakistan and is also officially
                    recognized, or “scheduled,” in the constitution of India. Significant speech
                    communities exist in the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the
                    United States as well. Notably, Urdu and Hindi are mutually intelligible.

                    Urdu has been called one of the most beautiful and sophisticated languages spoken
                    around the world. It is why Urdu speakers are such a delight to listen to and just
                    by listening to Urdu poetry or music, it makes you want to learn Urdu. Perhaps
                    you've already heard it in a movie or a song, maybe you have Pakistani or Indian
                    neighbors? It sounds very much like Hindi because it was born in the Indian
                    subcontinent. Also known as the 'Kohinoor' of India, this Indo-European language
                    developed in and around Delhi during the Delhi Sultanate and became the preferred
                    language of the Mughals during the Mughal Empire. The Urdu language formed from
                    Khariboli which was spoken in North India at the time, picking up regional dialects
                    and including Persian and Arabic contributions and influences along the way.

                    Urdu developed in the 12th century CE from the regional Apabhramsha of northwestern
                    India, serving as a linguistic modus vivendi after the Muslim conquest. Its first
                    major poet was Amir Khosrow (1253-1325), who composed dohas (couplets), folk songs,
                    and riddles in the newly formed speech, then called Hindvi. This mixed speech was
                    variously called Hindvi, Zaban-e-Hind, Hindi, Zaban-e-Delhi, Rekhta, Gujari,
                    Dakkhani, Zaban-e-Urdu-e-Mualla, Zaban-e-Urdu, or just Urdu, literally 'the language
                    of the camp.' Major Urdu writers continued to refer to it as Hindi or Hindvi until
                    the beginning of the 19th century, although there is evidence that it was called
                    Hindustani in the late 17th century.

                    Urdu started developing in north India around Delhi in about the 12th century. It was based on the language spoken in the region around Delhi, and it was heavily influenced by Arabic and Persian, as well as Turkish.
                    Urdu shares its origins with Hindi, sometimes referred to as a 'sister' language of Urdu due to the similar grammar base that they share. However, Hindi went on to be written in 'Devanagri', the same script as Sanskrit, and its vocabulary has more of a Sanskrit influence than a Persian and Arabic influence.
                    During the 14th and 15th centuries, much poetry and literature began to be written in Urdu. More recently, Urdu has mainly been connected with the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent, but there are many major works of Urdu literature written by Hindu and Sikh writers.
                    After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Urdu was chosen to be the national language of the new country. Today Urdu is spoken in many countries around the world, including Britain, Canada, the USA, the Middle East and India. In fact there are more Urdu speakers in India than there are in Pakistan.
