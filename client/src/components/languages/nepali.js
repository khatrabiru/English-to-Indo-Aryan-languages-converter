                    Nepali language, also called Gurkha, Gorkhali, Gurkhali,
                    or Khaskura, member of the Pahari subgroup of the Indo-Aryan
                    group of the Indo-Iranian division of the Indo-European
                    languages. Nepali is spoken by more than 17 million people,
                    mostly in Nepal, neighbouring parts of India and about a
                    quarter of the population in Bhutan.
                    The origin of modern Nepali language is believed to be from
                    Sinja valley of Jumla. Historically, the language was only spoken
                    by the Khas people of Karnali Region. An archaic dialect of the
                    language is spoken in Karnali.

            <h1>History</h1>
                <p>
                    Nepali is said to have originated from a now extinct language called
                    'Khas Kura' or the Khas talk. The Khas people were ancient war tribes
                    living in what we now call Uttarakhand in India and Western Nepal.
                    According to Mahabharata, the Khasas are mentioned as barbaric tribes
                    fighting for the Kaurava army. The modern Nepali language has
                    numerous features and words which suggest that the language is
                    ancient.

                    Since the creation of greater Nepal, the Nepali language has
                    been popular as an easy means of communication between all
                    language speakers of the nation. Many years before the creation
                    of greater Nepal, the Nepali language had been in use from
                    Bhramhaputra in the east and Kashmir in the west. The linguists
                    have taken the stone inscription of Adityabanshi king Damupal,
                    dating back to 1038 BS, as the official source of Nepali language.
                    A copperplate inscription dating back to 1280 BS is the historical
                    vidence of Krachalya Kings victory over Kedar-land Gadawal to create
                    Sija's Rigime. After studying the gold inscription of Prithvi Malla
                    of 1413 B.S, we can surmise that the Nepali language came into
                    existence in Gorkha and Gadawal since then.
