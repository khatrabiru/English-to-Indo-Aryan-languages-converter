                Nepali language, also called Gurkha, Gorkhali, Gurkhali, 
                or Khaskura, member of the Pahari subgroup of the Indo-Aryan 
                group of the Indo-Iranian division of the Indo-European 
                languages. Nepali is spoken by more than 17 million people, 
                mostly in Nepal, neighbouring parts of India and about a 
                quarter of the population in Bhutan.
                The origin of modern Nepali language is believed to be from 
                Sinja valley of Jumla. Historically, the language was only spoken 
                by the Khas people of Karnali Region. An archaic dialect of the 
                language is spoken in Karnali.
